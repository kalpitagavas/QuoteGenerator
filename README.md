# 🔥 Week 1 of 5: Random Quote Generator (Backend)

I’ve started a 5-week challenge to build and showcase a new full-stack project every week using **React** and **MongoDB**.

This repository contains the **backend** of the **Random Quote Generator** built with:

- 📦 Node.js + Express  
- 📚 MongoDB + Mongoose  
- 🌐 REST API (GET, POST, Random, Bulk insert)
